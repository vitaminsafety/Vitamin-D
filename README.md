Neubewertung der European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)

• Erhöhung der tolerierbaren Gesamtzufuhrmenge an Vitamin D von täglich
50 µg "2000 IE" auf 100 µg => Verdopplung [EFSA, 2012]

• „No observed adverse effect level“ (NOAEL) liegt bei 250 µg "10000 IE" Vitamin D
täglich [EFSA, 2012]

Revaluation of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)

• Increased the tolerable level of Vitamin D from daily
50 µg "2000 IU" to 100 µg "4000 IE"=> double [EFSA, 2012]

• „No observed adverse effect level“ (NOAEL) is 250 µg "10000 IU" Vitamin D
daily [EFSA, 2012]

RISK CHARACTERIZATION
In conclusion, unfortified foods, fortified foods, and most
dietary supplements, combined, do not contribute to a total exposure anywhere near 
the recommended vitamin D Upper Limit of 250 µg "10000 IU" daily. 
There is little prospect of exposure of the healthy general
population to toxic levels of vitamin D with current or likely
levels in fortified foods and dietary supplements. Therefore, total
exposure to vitamin D, including autogenous production under
UV light stimulation, is very unlikely to exceed this proposed Upper Limit VITAMIN D SAFETY

Combining this proposed UL with total erythemic sunlight
exposure and typical dietary and supplemental sources all at once
would still result in a serum 25(OH)D concentration (~500 nmol/L) 
that is well below the estimated concentration associated with hypercalcemia (>600 nmol/L). 
Indeed, there is a lot of room for increased vitamin D intakes without risk of overdose.
Much larger amounts, up to 2500 µg "100000 IU", have shown no toxicity if
restricted to 1 occasion per 4 month or daily for a single period of 4 days
